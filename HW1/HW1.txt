Problem 1:
1) Read student ID and store in array. Either resize for each new ID
or find total number of IDs first then store. 
2) Store a number within the array size from a
random number generator.
3) Use the stored number to assign a leaving student a random ID.
Remove an id from the array and reduce both id array and possible
number generated from random number by 1.
4) Reapeat 2-3
5) Once all students have an ID, the first student will compare his
id with 2nd on so forth. If student already has his id, skip
to next student.
6) If he finds his id, he will switch with the student that has it.
7) Repeat 5-6 but with the next student in line.
8) Students leave once all ids are matched.

Problem 2   
1) Store number.
2) Read first number (smallest value) and multiply by 1 then store
it as int num1.
3) Read 2nd number and multiply by 12,3rd by 144 and so on all while
storing in new int like num2 or num3.
4) If the number is A, convert it 10, B as 11. Multiply appropriately 
depending on which number it is on. (So x1 for 1st or x12 for 2nd)
5) Stop reading when next number is empty.
6) Add num1,num2,num3,etc and store this number in int sum.
7) Display Sum.

Problem 3
1) Read and store the two strings in W1 and W2.
2) Compare the first character of each string.
3) To compare, convert character into it's numerical value.
4) Move on to next if difference in values is 0.
5) Repeat 2-4 until comparison does not equal 0.
6) Store the positive difference of values as int difW.
6) Display comparison that resembles "W1 is [W1] and W2 [W2]
so Lex-dif is [difW] since [equation that results in positive
integer] [difW]". All in brackets are substituted appropirately.
